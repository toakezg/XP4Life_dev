# DCS Workflow Relay

## Objective
Keep the DCS workflow from living only inside one repo. Carry the repeatable check loop into a shared, stage-aware maintenance path, prove the stable evidence still holds, and leave behind a short prompt that another operator can pick up without re-deriving the route.

## Tasks
- [x] Ground the repeated checks
  - [x] Re-read the DCS packet and current workflow note
  - [x] Verify the repaired `.venv` and the graph-collapse result
- [x] Build the reusable workflow note
  - [x] Add universal DCS workflow framing
  - [x] Record improvements and weaknesses
  - [x] Add stage-aware sequencing
- [x] Add the prompt-ready entry forms
  - [x] Add the reusable prompt structure
  - [x] Add the short prompt
- [x] Anchor the shared workflows home
  - [x] Point the note to `F:\toakezg\workflows`
  - [x] Mark project docs as local evidence
- [ ] Promote the workflow README to the shared home
  - [x] Create or sync the reusable workflow README under `F:\toakezg\workflows`
  - [x] Keep project note and shared note aligned ✅ 2026-05-10
  - [ ] Confirm future runs can start from the shared root

## Rewards
- XP: 280
- Achievement Unlocks: DCS-SYS-003
- Title Reward: Workflow Cartographer

## Completion Proof
- The reusable workflow note exists and is stage-aware.
- The prompt-ready short form exists for repeated maintenance runs.
- The shared workflows home is named explicitly.
- The remaining promotion gate is tracked as a deliberate open task, not forgotten state.

## Source Notes
- `docs/dcs/4-reflection/REPEATED_CHECK_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/dcs/4-reflection/DCS_STABLE_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_001.md`
- `docs/dcs/DCS_HANDOFF_PACKET.md`
- `F:\toakezg\workflows`

## Notes
- Hand-authored from the repeated DCS workflow evidence and the `$create-quest-from-workflow` quest pattern.
- This quest is intentionally `active`, not completed.
- The remaining open gate is the shared-workflows promotion step, which keeps the workflow growth honest and future-facing.
