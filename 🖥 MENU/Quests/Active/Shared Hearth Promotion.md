# Shared Hearth Promotion

## Objective
Carry the reusable DCS workflow into the shared hearth at `F:\toakezg\workflows`, prove the route still lines up with the stage-aware maintenance path, and leave behind a stable entry point so future operators can start from the shared root instead of rediscovering the trail.

## Tasks
- [ ] Reopen the hearth map
  - [ ] Re-read the current DCS packet, the reusable workflow note, and the shared-workflows rule.
  - [ ] Confirm the work is sitting at the promotion gate, not a fresh graph audit.
- [ ] Forge the shared README
  - [ ] Create or sync the reusable workflow README under `F:\toakezg\workflows`.
  - [ ] Keep the reusable prompt and stage-aware sequence aligned with the project note.
- [ ] Seal the route
  - [ ] Keep the project note and shared note in sync.
  - [ ] Preserve the stable/one-off split so the shared note stays lean.
- [ ] Prove the path
  - [ ] Confirm future runs can start from `F:\toakezg\workflows`.
  - [ ] Leave a compact next prompt that lands at the shared root cleanly.

## Task Order Map
```dataviewjs
const allTasks = dv.current().file.tasks.array();

const doneByText = Object.fromEntries(
  allTasks.map(t => [t.text.replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim(), t.completed])
);

## Workflow Map
```dataviewjs
const topTasks = dv.current().file.tasks
  .where(t => !t.parent)
  .array();

const doneByText = Object.fromEntries(

## Rewards
- XP: 240
- Achievement Unlocks: DCS-SYS-005
- Title Reward: Hearth Keeper

## Completion Proof
- The reusable workflow README exists or has been synced under `F:\toakezg\workflows`.
- The shared-root entry point is explicit and stage-aware.
- The project note and shared note remain aligned without turning the shared note into a dump of local detail.

## Source Notes
- `docs/dcs/4-reflection/REPEATED_CHECK_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/dcs/4-reflection/DCS_STABLE_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_001.md`
- `docs/dcs/DCS_HANDOFF_PACKET.md`
- `F:\toakezg\workflows`

## Notes
- This quest is a companion route to `DCS Workflow Relay`, not a duplicate.
- Its purpose is to make the shared-workflows promotion gate feel like a playable mission.
- The shared root is the destination; the workflow note in the project remains the evidence trail.
