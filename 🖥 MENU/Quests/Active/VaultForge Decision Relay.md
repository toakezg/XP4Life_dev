# VaultForge Decision Relay

## Objective
The VaultForge lanes are lit, but the gates still need names, proofs, and clean handoffs. Walk the relay from business priority to final task-board sync: decide what is ready, keep the protected switches closed, and turn every loose thread into a next action that another operator can follow without drift.

## Tasks
- [x] Confirm the VaultForge preflight state
  - [x] Read `F:\vaultforge\NATH_TASKS_STEP_GUIDE_10-05-26.md` ✅ 2026-05-10
  - [x] Check root dirty state and known Workflow B resume flag issue
  - [x] Keep hard gates closed for pricing, licensing, publication, live generation, paid/API use, asset moves, target writes, folder icon application, and engine registry migration
- [ ] Convert the old business priority note into current business tasks
  - [ ] Confirm whether `vaultforge-business` is the current priority lane
  - [ ] Replace vague "business goals" language with the current goal stack
  - [ ] Close or park the old note only after the replacement task shape is clear
- [x] Open or refresh the business thread
  - [x] Name the next milestone
  - [x] Keep the thread scoped to Nath-facing decision surfaces
  - [x] Update `vaultforge-business\SIGN_UP.md` with the handoff
- [x] Draft the paid launch decision note
  - [x] Record what is ready now: intake, prompt bank, wrappers, review flow, contact sheets, gallery, delivery skeleton, and service catalog
  - [x] Record what is not ready yet: legal language, license terms, public pricing, trademark claims, full automation, and broad print promises
  - [x] Present launch posture choices without treating any option as approved
- [x] Decide fragment ownership and registry shape
  - [x] Review `BUSINESS_FRAGMENT_LIBRARY_CANDIDATES.md`
  - [x] Decide between business-local mappings, lane-aware aliases, production constraints, or stable styles only
  - [x] Keep `business-fragment-library-move` blocked until the registry decision is explicit
- [ ] Record the Gallable proposal decision
  - [ ] Review the generated PNG, proposal note, and run log
  - [ ] Choose accept for size check, reroll, reject/park, or separate target apply task
  - [ ] Avoid target-project writes unless the target path and write scope are approved
- [ ] Decide the `#active` and schedule rule
  - [ ] Treat `#active` as a Nath focus signal only if adopted
  - [ ] Use schedule or due metadata only when the timing is real
  - [ ] Update root and affected section docs if the rule changes agent behavior
- [ ] Close the relay cleanly
  - [ ] Update source task boards after decisions are written down
  - [ ] Create separate implementation tasks for anything still incomplete
  - [ ] Copy the prompt-ready handoff for the future thread

## Rewards
- XP: 360
- Achievement Unlocks: VF-SYS-004, VF-BLD-004
- Title Reward: Gatekeeper I

## Completion Proof
- The VaultForge Nath decision wave has written decisions, updated source task boards, and a prompt-ready handoff.
- Any remaining implementation work is split into separate tasks with lane owner, scope, blockers, and approval gates.

## Source Notes
- [[NATH_TASKS_STEP_GUIDE_10-05-26]]
- `F:\vaultforge\vaultforge-xp4l\VAULT_OUTPUT_SHAPE.md`
- `F:\vaultforge\vaultforge-xp4l\QUEST_QUERY_FIX_2026-04-17.md`

## Notes
- This is a hand-authored quest. It follows the XP4Life quest surface and keeps generated XP4L output separate.
- Deep scan 2026-05-10: preflight was verified against root `git status`, `HARD_GATES.md`, `NATH_TASKS_STEP_GUIDE_10-05-26.md`, and the known Workflow B resume-command caveat.
- Business thread refresh is evidenced by `vaultforge-business/NATH_START.md`, `README.md`, and `SIGN_UP.md`, including the paid-launch decision note handoff and next-step framing.
- Paid launch decision note is complete as a decision surface at `vaultforge-business/BUSINESS_PAID_LAUNCH_DECISION_NOTE.md`; it names ready/not-ready surfaces and keeps pricing, licensing, publication, and live/API generation as explicit decisions.
- Fragment ownership has a scoped answer in the current engine/business bridge: engine commit `c0e2d37` and business commit `4e59f85` support approved business-facing aliases and production constraints while keeping remaining business-only fragments lane-owned unless later approved.
- Still open: old business-priority note conversion, Gallable taste decision, `#active`/schedule rule, and final task-board closure.
