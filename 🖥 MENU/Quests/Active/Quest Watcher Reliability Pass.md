# Quest Watcher Reliability Pass

## Objective
The quest watcher is awake, but it is still a hidden process tied to the current Windows session. Turn the terminal findings into a sturdier operating path: prove when the watcher is alive, decide whether it needs Task Scheduler persistence, widen its task matching carefully, and prepare XP4L event records without letting automation mark vague work as done.

## Tasks
- [ ] Confirm the watcher operating contract
  - [ ] Record the current launch command, PID file, log path, and 20-second scan interval.
  - [ ] Document what survives terminal inactivity, sleep, reboot, and logout.
  - [ ] Keep the stop command visible for manual control.
- [ ] Decide persistence level
  - [ ] Choose between hidden session process, manual launch, or Windows Task Scheduler.
  - [ ] If Task Scheduler is chosen, define trigger, working directory, and log/exit handling before implementation.
  - [ ] Keep plugin-like watcher behavior optional and additive to plain markdown.
- [ ] Expand completion matching carefully
  - [ ] Add only evidence-backed task detectors for recurring quest types.
  - [ ] Avoid marking taste, approval, live generation, paid/API, asset movement, or target-write decisions complete without explicit proof.
  - [ ] Keep active quest notes and proposal/source notes synchronized where both exist.
- [ ] Prepare XP4L event relay
  - [ ] Dry-run event records for completed watcher, quest scan, and DCS maturity work.
  - [ ] Review inferred event source, category, action, context, and tags before live write.
  - [ ] Write to `.4/inbox/events` only after explicit live/write approval.
- [ ] Verify and close the pass
  - [ ] Run one watcher scan after changes and confirm the log timestamp updates.
  - [ ] Confirm no duplicate event records are created.
  - [ ] Update the relevant quest notes with final proof and remaining limits.

## Rewards
- XP: 220
- Achievement Unlocks: VF-SYS-003
- Title Reward: Watch Keeper I

## Completion Proof
- Watcher persistence choice is documented.
- Manual stop/restart commands are visible.
- New task matching rules are evidence-based and gate-safe.
- XP4L event records are dry-run reviewed before any live `.4` write.
- Watcher log proves the final scan is running.

## Notes
- Hand-authored from this terminal output stream using `$create-quest-from-workflow`.
- Keep the watcher an enhancement layer. XP4Life quests must remain readable and usable as plain Obsidian markdown.
