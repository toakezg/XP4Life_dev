# Thread Thinker Hidden Route Survey

## Objective
The Thread Thinker board is playable, but the useful signal is now spread across completed passes, ignored local folders, skill notes, and next-prompt gates. Survey the route: lock down what is already proven, keep the hidden machine-state out of the evidence trail, then choose the next bounded pass without letting polish, persistence, or automation slip in through the side door.

## Tasks
- [x] Inventory completed unlocks
  - [x] Confirm the six-puzzle starter pack and solve-gated flow are verified.
  - [x] Confirm DCS-5 visual diagnostics, DCS-6 deterministic helpers, and DCS-7 session loop are documented.
  - [x] Confirm the local `dcs-recursive-forge` skill has validation evidence.
- [x] Separate hidden and ignored state
  - [x] Confirm `.obsidian/`, `.venv/`, `.tmp/`, `.pip-cache/`, and generated marker-toggle screenshots are ignored.
  - [x] Record that `.tmp/` contains permission-denied pip leftovers and should stay out of evidence scans.
  - [x] Keep runtime source checks focused on tracked files and documented artifacts.
- [ ] Choose the next bounded route
  - [ ] Decide between docs-only forward test, implementation-ready DCS-3 node, or playtest-polish pass.
  - [ ] Keep DCS-7 persistence, external agents, save systems, generators, and broad platform work behind explicit approval.
  - [ ] Write the selected next prompt before editing runtime code.
- [ ] Run the selected follow-up
  - [ ] If docs-only, use a target outside Thread Thinker and write only under that target's `docs/dcs`.
  - [ ] If gameplay polish, verify in browser and tie every change to concrete playtest friction.
  - [ ] If diagnostics export is needed, add only the smallest manual copy path.
- [ ] Close the route with proof
  - [ ] Update the DCS handoff packet and progress log with exact commands and results.
  - [ ] Confirm no ignored/cache folders entered the repo evidence.
  - [ ] Write XP4Life event records for the completed follow-up without duplicating this survey event.

## Rewards
- XP: 260
- Achievement Unlocks: DCS-SYS-004
- Title Reward: Route Surveyor I

## Completion Proof
- Selected next route is written as a bounded prompt.
- Follow-up pass is verified with exact commands or browser proof.
- `docs/dcs/DCS_HANDOFF_PACKET.md` and `progress.md` are updated with the result.
- Ignored/cache folders remain out of repo evidence and XP4Life event context.

- The hidden state found during inspection is operational evidence only, not quest content to import into the repo.
