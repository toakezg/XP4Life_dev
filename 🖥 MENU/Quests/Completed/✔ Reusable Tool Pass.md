# Reusable Tool Pass

## Objective
Ship one useful tool or script that solves a real problem and gets used more than once.

## Tasks
- [x] Choose one repetitive problem worth solving ✅ 2026-05-02
- [x] Build the smallest useful script or helper ✅ 2026-05-02
- [x] Test it on a real task ✅ 2026-05-10
- [x] Use it at least three separate times ✅ 2026-05-10
- [x] Document what it saves or improves ✅ 2026-05-10

## Rewards
- XP: 280
- Achievement Unlocks: VF-BLD-001, VF-BLD-002
- Title Reward: Toolsmith

## Completion Proof
- Script, command, or automation exists and has been used repeatedly.

## Notes
- This quest matters more for repeat use than technical complexity.
- Deep scan closeout: the reusable helper is `F:\XP4Life\Systems\XP4L\Tools\watch-vaultforge-quest-tasks.ps1`. It watches `F:\vaultforge` evidence, updates active/proposal quest checkboxes, and records scan activity in `Systems\XP4L\State\vaultforge-quest-watch.log`. It has already been used for the initial watcher pass, the deep quest scan, repeated 20-second scan checks, and terminal inactivity verification.
- It saves repeated manual comparison between quest checklists, VaultForge task boards, run packets, hard gates, and section handoff notes.
