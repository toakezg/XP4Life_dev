# VaultForge Six Hour Workflow B Reconciliation

## Objective
The last six-hour VaultForge wave left a trail of commits, run packets, hard gates, business decisions, engine evidence, and XP4L residue. Walk the relay from raw evidence to clean handoff: prove what changed, keep the closed gates closed, and leave the next operator with one route through the dust instead of a stack of half-read signals.

## Tasks
- [x] Gather the six-hour evidence
  - [x] Compare `git log --since='6 hours ago'` against the recent `runs/workflow-b/` packet folders.
  - [x] Record the four root commits in scope: `073b0c0`, `15aa39f`, `31d14dd`, and `a667192`.
  - [x] Note non-commit events: operator plugin timestamps, processed XP4L inbox event, and dirty nested `vaultforge-xp4l` state.
- [x] Verify Workflow B control surface changes
  - [x] Review `HARD_GATES.md` and confirm unresolved gates still default to stop/report.
  - [x] Check `MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW_B.md`, `workflow_b.md`, and `workflow_b_controller.py` for the recorded Workflow B changes.
  - [x] Keep the resume-command caveat visible until `--execute`, `--commit-mode review`, and `--hard-gate-mode switch-safe` emission is repaired.
- [x] Close the engine verification track
  - [x] Read `vaultforge-engine/SIGN_UP.md` and `vaultforge-engine/VERIFICATION.md`.
  - [x] Confirm the engine cycles stayed evidence-only and did not implement the contact-sheet renderer.
  - [x] Preserve the `#live-required` gate for real sidecar evidence or an approved fixture strategy.
- [x] Close the business decision track
  - [x] Read `vaultforge-business/BUSINESS_PAID_LAUNCH_DECISION_NOTE.md`.
  - [x] Confirm the paid launch decision remains a 0/1 Nath choice, not an approval by implication.
  - [x] Check business `README.md`, `NATH_START.md`, `TASKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `SIGN_UP.md` for the handoff links.
- [x] Reconcile XP4L and event residue
  - [x] Inspect the processed inbox event from `processed/inbox/events/`.
  - [x] Inspect nested `vaultforge-xp4l` dirty files and decide whether they are current work, prior residue, or a separate follow-up.
  - [x] Keep non-dry-run live `E:\XP4Life` materialization gated unless a specific run is approved.
- [x] Write the final handoff path
  - [x] Summarize what is proven, what is still dirty, and what gates remain blocked.
  - [x] Split any implementation or cleanup still needed into lane-owned follow-up tasks.
  - [x] Point the next Workflow B run at either the resume-command repair or a clearly approved docs-only/dry-run slice.

## Rewards
- XP: 340
- Achievement Unlocks: VF-OPS-WFB-003, VF-SYS-005
- Title Reward: Run Archivist I

## Completion Proof
- The six-hour commit list, run-packet list, non-commit event list, and dirty nested `vaultforge-xp4l` state are reconciled in one handoff.
- Workflow B hard-gate status and resume-command caveat are recorded without implying approval.
- Engine, business, and XP4L follow-ups are split by lane with blocked gates preserved.
- The next Workflow B route is explicit: resume-command repair or a named approved docs-only/dry-run slice.

## Notes
- This is a hand-authored active quest generated from repo evidence inspected on 2026-05-10.
- Deep scan 2026-05-10: current six-hour `git log` now shows later consolidation commit `ca86f72` plus scoped commits `c0e2d37` and `4e59f85`; the quest's older commit IDs are preserved as source evidence in the note and run packet history. Recent Workflow B packets under `runs/workflow-b/` remain readable.
- `HARD_GATES.md` exists and uses `default_if_blank: stop/report before acting`; current blockers still include the resume-command caveat, `HG-008:0` for XP4L scoring/progression, and named-scope requirements for live/API/materialization work.
- Engine evidence in `vaultforge-engine/SIGN_UP.md` and `VERIFICATION.md` repeatedly confirms evidence-only cycles, passing checks, empty gallery/index checks, and no contact-sheet renderer implementation.
- Business evidence in `vaultforge-business/BUSINESS_PAID_LAUNCH_DECISION_NOTE.md` and `SIGN_UP.md` confirms the paid launch note is a decision surface, not an approval by implication.
- XP4L residue is real and separate: root status shows dirty nested `vaultforge-xp4l`; nested status shows `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `SIGN_UP.md`, `TASKS.md`, and untracked `VAULT_OUTPUT_SHAPE.md`. Treat that as a lane-owned follow-up, not silent completion.
- Next route: fix `root-workflow-b-resume-execute-flag`, or run a clearly named docs-only/dry-run lane slice. Keep live vault writes, scoring/progression changes, paid/API work, public launch, asset operations, target writes, and engine registry expansion gated unless explicitly approved.
- No repo source file was changed by this quest note.
